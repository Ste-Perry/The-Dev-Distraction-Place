#The Dev Distraction Place
As a team we could do whatever we wanted so we all choose somthing to do ourself and bring it together on diffrent pages withing 8 hours.
I made the  tik tak toe game with react wich was alot harder then i expected but got thru it. With the time left i offed my help to my team members to help them finish off their parts of the project to put it all together.
